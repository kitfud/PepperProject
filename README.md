There are a lot of feature to discover in this app and the key ones to highlight involve the plant detail pages and the "my garden tab." Users can keep tabs of how many other people "heart" their plants and also will be notified by a color changing button whenever someone makes a comment on a picture of a plant they have uploaded.

Additionally- per uploaded plant, a user can update the info on the plant (that they uploaded) as it grows and can also add updated images of a specific plant (idea is to do this as it grows!), to the "Plant Diary."

Every "Heart" on a plant changes the overall number of "likes" recorded on the page view. Posting a comment on a plant changes the color of the bell symbol to yellow in the Navbar:

Backend Database: has been setup using Firebase cloud server in a non-relational database style for referencing documents about each plant + user upload.
